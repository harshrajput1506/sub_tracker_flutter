# ðŸš€ Setup Guide

## Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK: ^3.9.0
- Dart SDK: ^3.9.0
- Android Studio / VS Code
- Git

## Installation Steps

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd sub_tracker
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### 3. Generate Code

Generate Hive type adapters and dependency injection code:

```bash
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

Or watch for changes during development:

```bash
flutter pub run build_runner watch --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

### 4. Run the App

#### Android/iOS
```bash
flutter run
```

#### Web
```bash
flutter run -d chrome
```

#### Specific Device
```bash
# List available devices
flutter devices

# Run on specific device
flutter run -d <device-id>
```

## Development Workflow

### Code Generation

Whenever you create or modify models with Hive annotations, run:

```bash
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

### Linting & Formatting

```bash
# Analyze code
flutter analyze

# Format code
flutter format lib/
```

### Clean Build

If you encounter issues:

```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
flutter run
```

## Building for Production

### Android APK

```bash
flutter build apk --release
```

Output: `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk`

### Android App Bundle (for Play Store)

```bash
flutter build appbundle --release
```

Output: `build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab`

### iOS

```bash
flutter build ios --release
```

### Web

```bash
flutter build web --release
```

Output: `build/web/`

## Testing

### Run All Tests

```bash
flutter test
```

### Run Specific Test

```bash
flutter test test/path/to/test_file.dart
```

### Test Coverage

```bash
flutter test --coverage
```

## Environment Setup

### VS Code Extensions (Recommended)

- Flutter
- Dart
- Prettier
- Error Lens
- GitLens

### Android Studio Plugins (Recommended)

- Flutter
- Dart

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Build Runner Fails

```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter pub run build_runner clean
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

### Issue: Hive Box Errors

Delete app data and restart:
```bash
flutter clean
flutter run
```

### Issue: Dependency Conflicts

```bash
flutter pub upgrade
flutter pub get
```

### Issue: Gradle Build Fails (Android)

```bash
cd android
./gradlew clean
cd ..
flutter clean
flutter run
```
